# LSTM Time Series Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a *Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network* for *time series forecasting*. It covers the entire pipeline from data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and normalization for time series input  
- LSTM-based deep learning model implementation in TensorFlow/Keras  
- Model training with evaluation metrics (MSE, RMSE, etc.)  
- Visualization of training history and predictions vs actual values  
- Well-documented Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step understanding  

## Tech Stack
- *Python*  
- *TensorFlow / Keras*  
- *NumPy, Pandas*  
- *Matplotlib / Seaborn*  

## Results
- Achieved accurate time series forecasting using LSTM  
- Compared model predictions against ground truth with visual plots  
- Demonstrated the power of recurrent networks in sequential data problems
